I know it may sound racist but, I use my guts to evaluate if a person can be trusted or not, I look the person in the eyes and then I make up my mind quite soon. This is my method.

The system is okay if it is addressed to AI, I am a human and I need to feel the human touch to come up with a reliable decision. I need more personal data, something that can help me figuring out who this person really is. I loved the filtering option, it's extremely useful. Some of the data you provided, mostly the ones at the end of the form, appear to be redundant and useless, I'd get rid of some of them.
